# MiniCIV

MiniCiv is an 8-bit local-multiplayer browser-game recreation of Sid Meyer's Civilization (1991) where players can play a Civ game with a map they can pick as anywhere in the world. Upon starting their game, players can choose their Civilization and their map using a Google Maps interactive map, and are then put into a game where they can found cities, build roads, create warriors to defend themselves, choose the production of their cities, all like an actual miniature Civ game!
